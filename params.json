{"name":"Pretotype Template for Evolus Pencil","tagline":"An html export template to render your interactive mockup as a \"usable\" pretotype","body":"### What is this\r\nThis is an html export template for the Evolus Pencil http://pencil.evolus.vn/ prototyping tool. It is an adaptation of the Default HTML Template that ships with Pencil. The aim of this template is to output your pencil project as a \"usable\" [pretotype](http://www.pretotyping.org/).\r\n\r\nYou should consider using this template if you wish to present your mockups as an interactive story. You essentially get a clean output, no chrome and notes that only show up if the user want to see them.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n* Convincingly simulates an actual app, given an appropriate flow of pages\r\n* Clean output, your page mockups are center stage\r\n* Quick access to page notes\r\n* Page notes available with through nifty unobtrusive button \r\n* Light - does not depend on any heavy JavaScript libraries\r\n\r\n### Releases\r\n\r\n#### Latest: v0.4.6-b, May 27 2013 \r\n[Download v0.4.6-b](https://github.com/rudylattae/evoluspencil-pretotype-template/raw/master/dist/EvolusPencil-PretotypeTemplate-0.4.6-b.zip)\r\n* First public beta release\r\n* Added support to show in full screen when pinned to home screen in iOS\r\n* Present notes to right side of screen\r\n* Scale to viewport when launched to support viewing on mobile devices\r\n\r\n### Getting started\r\nIf you are already using Pencil, I assume you know how to install and use export templates. If you have no idea what Pencil is, please take a moment to check out [this useful tool](http://pencil.evolus.vn) from the folks at [Evolus](http://evolus.vn/en-US/Default.aspx). \r\n\r\nUsing the Pretotype template follows the same workflow as any other HTML Export template in the Evolus ecosystem:\r\n\r\n1. Download (see the Releases section above) or simply grab the [**latest version**](https://github.com/rudylattae/evoluspencil-pretotype-template/raw/master/dist/EvolusPencil-PretotypeTemplate-0.4.6-b.zip)\r\n2. Install the template through the `Tools > Manage Export Template` menu\r\n3. Export your mockup with the template by using the `Document > Export Document...` wizard. \r\n    * Choose to export a `Single web page` for the `Output format`\r\n    * Select `All pages in the document` for `pages to export`\r\n    * Select the `Pretotype Template` as your export template, provide a destination and click `Done`\r\n\r\n**NOTE!** The above steps are pretty typical in any conventional Pencil worflow. However there is one thing you must note:\r\n\r\n**Your mockup must have one page called \"Start\"**! If you do not do this, the template will not know which of your pages to show first.\r\n\r\n### How it works\r\nThis template provides a simple Html5 index.html file with the supporting JavaScript and Stylesheets. The JavaScript and CSS work together to hide all but the active page from view. \r\n\r\nThe screen you see when you launch your pretotype, will have scrolling disabled. You will only be able to jump between pages by clicking/tapping on navigation you created by linking UI elements to pages.\r\n\r\nAny notes that you created for a page, would be hidden. However, when viewing the page, you will be able to bring up the notes by clicking/tapping the (?) icon to the top right of the screen.\r\n\r\n### Supported browsers and known limitations\r\n\r\n#### v0.4.6-b\r\n\r\n**Desktop**\r\n* Google Chrome 27 (Mac, Win) -- full support\r\n* FireFox 16 (Mac, Win) -- broken\r\n* Internet Explorer 9 (Win) -- not tested\r\n* Internet Explorer 10 (Win) -- not teste\r\n\r\n**Mobile**\r\n* Safari (iOS) -- full support\r\n* Google Chrome (Android) -- full support\r\n* FireFox (Android) -- not tested\r\n\r\n### FAQs\r\n1. **Why is this called a \"pretotype\" template?** You've not heard about \"Pretotyping\"?
