{"name":"Pretotype html export template for Evolus Pencil","tagline":"An html export template to render your interactive mockup as a pretotype","body":"### What is this\r\nThis is an html export template for the Evolus Pencil http://pencil.evolus.vn/ prototyping tool. \r\n\r\nYou should consider using this template if you wish to present your mockups as an interactive story. You essentially get a clean output, no chrome and notes that only show up if the user want to see them.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n* Convincingly simulates an actual app\r\n* Clean output, your page mockups are centre-stage\r\n* Quick access to page notes\r\n* Smart design shares screen space between pages and notes\r\n* Light - does not depend on any heavy JavaScript libraries\r\n\r\n### Releases\r\n**Latest**: v0.4.6-b, May 27 2013 \r\nhttps://github.com/rudylattae/evoluspencil-pretotype-template/raw/master/dist/EvolusPencil-PretotypeTemplate-0.4.6-b.zip\r\n* First public beta release\r\n* Added support to show in full screen when pinned to home screen in iOS\r\n* Present notes to right side of screen\r\n* Scale to viewport when launched to support viewing on mobile devices\r\n\r\n### Getting started\r\nSince you are already using Pencil, I assume you know how to install and use export templates. The Pretotype template follows the same workflow. However there is one thing you must note:\r\n\r\n**Your mockup must have one page called \"Start\"**! If you do not do this, the template will not know which of your pages to show first.\r\n\r\n### How it works\r\nThis template provides a simple Html5 index.html file with the supporting JavaScript and Stylesheets. The JavaScript and CSS work together to hide all but the active page from view. \r\n\r\nThe screen you see when you launch your pretotype, will have scrolling disabled. You will only be able to jump between pages by clicking/tapping on navigation you created by linking UI elements to pages.\r\n\r\nAny notes that you created for a page, would be hidden. However, when viewing the page, you will be able to bring up the notes by clicking/tapping the (?) icon to the top right of the screen.\r\n\r\n### FAQs\r\n1. **Why is this called a \"pretotype\" template?** You've not heard about \"Pretotyping\"?
